# Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio
This repository contains fully documented cybersecurity lab enviroment designed for secure testing, OS hardening and vulnerability assessment. It demonstrates particular skills in system configuration, secure environment setup, and analysis of security risks.

## 🔧 Lab Objectives
- Build controlled environment for testing cybersecurity tools and environments.
- Apply OS hardening techniques to reduce attack surface.
- Simulate common vulnerabilities and test detection/prevention strategies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Virtual Box
- Kali Linux, Ubuntu Server, Windows 10
- Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, UFW, Fail2ban
- PowerShell, Bash

## 📁 Structure
- 'kali/' - Contains installation and configuration steps for Kali Linux virtual machine, used for simulating attacker scenarious withing the lab environment.
- 'ubuntu-server/' - Contains setup and hardening documentation for Ubuntu Server, configured as part of internal network infrastructure.
- 'window10/' - Includes installation and security configuration for the Windows 100 workstation, representing a standard user machine withing the lab.

## 📌 Key Concepts
- Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
- Log monitoring and system auditing
- Secure configuration and file permissions

## 📝 Notes
All screenshots and logs are included in the respective section. This project reflects practical knowledge gained through a cybersecurity degree and independent research.
