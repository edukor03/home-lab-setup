#Single User Mode
Single user mode, also known as recovery mode, is a mode in which multi-user computer operating system (OS) boots into a single superuser. On Ubuntu Server by default recovery mode password is not set, meaning anyone with the knowledge of modifying kernal line in boot menu can get access to superuser.
